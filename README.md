# it-is-me
Proof enough?

Y_Less#4243 is me.  Discord screwed up my other account.

I tried to add the Epic games nitro thing, and now discord is claming there is something strange going on and want my phone number to log my main account back in.  I don't see why - I already have two factor authentication enabled.

I don't think Discord realise how unattached I am to that account.  I'd rather abandon it and start again than give them my phone number...
